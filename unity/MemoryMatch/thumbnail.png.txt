This is a placeholder for thumbnail.png

To add a thumbnail:
1. Create a 128x128 PNG image
2. Name it "thumbnail.png"
3. Place it in this directory (Assets/WebGLTemplates/ReactBridge/)
4. Delete this .txt file

For now, the template will work without a thumbnail.
It will appear in Unity's Player Settings under "Resolution and Presentation" > "WebGL Template"
